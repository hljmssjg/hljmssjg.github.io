I am an algorithm engineer at Hive Box, specializing in the field of embodied intelligence. My work involves controlling humanoid robot locomotion using reinforcement learning and employing imitation learning to control robotic arms for various industrial applications.

I hold a Master’s degree in Robotics and Control from Umeå University in Sweden. Before that, I participated in an exchange program during my fourth undergraduate year at Shenzhen University and earned dual Bachelor's degrees: one in Physics from Umeå University and another in Electronic Science and Technology from Shenzhen University. In addition, I have held previous positions at Great Wall and LimX Dynamics.

I am interested in research on the building embodied AI. My current research interest contains Embodied AI, Diffusion Model, Reinforcement Learning and Sim2real.

# Interests
When I’m not working with robots or coding, you’ll likely find me on a badminton court, at the gym (sometimes), or deep into a strategy game. **I reached Challenger rank with 1000+ LP in Sets 6, 8, 9, 12, and 13 of Teamfight Tactics**.
